# WoW_VR
World of Warcraft development in Virtual Reality... is something that I think would be awesome! 

This app is a simple one that takes approx 20 min to create. 
There is a standard camera designed for Oculus that starts you in a sceen with a star back drop and 3 menu boxes floating infront of you. 
No motion, jumping or stepping sound is available. 
There Is also a platform and a box to your lower left. If you look at the box it will teleport itself randomly along the y axis (up/down) somewhere between 0 and 3 feet.  
There is also a reticle that is always facing you no matter where you look that stays at a fixed distance away from you as an indicator for the user which direction your gaze is being registered in the game.
